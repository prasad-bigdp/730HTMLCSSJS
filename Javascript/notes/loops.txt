loops are used to repeat certain statements again and again until the condition is false
Each repitition is called Iteration.loops are primarily two types
  i. Entry Control loops
  ii. Exit Control loops

i. Entry control loops: Entry Control loops checks the condition at the starting the loop
  eg: while, for

ii. Exit Control loops: Exit control loops checks the condition at the ending of the loop
  eg: do-while

  a. while: while is a entry control loop which have a condition and executes a set of statements again and again until the condition is false
   syntax: intialization;
           while(condition){
            //set of statements;
            updation;
           }

    eg:let i = 0; //initialization;
while (i <= 10) // condition
{
    console.log(i);
    i++; //updation
}

  b. do while : doWhile checks the condition at the exit of the loop and repeat the set of statements execution if the condition is true
  syntax: 
  initialization;
  do{
    //statements;
    //updation;
  }while(condition);

 c. for loop: for loop is used to iterate certain statements until the condition is false but for allows you to write in single line all initialization,condition and updation.
  syntax for(initialization;condition;updation){
    //statements;
  }

  for..of : for of is used to iterate values of the array and 
  it provides each time array elements
  eg: for(let x of arrayname){
    console.log(x) 
  }
  The above loops runs until end of the array and each time it takes x as array elements

  for..in: for in is used to iterate values of the array and it provides each time array index. for in is ideal for objects
  eg: for(let x in arrayname){
    console.log(x) 
  }
  The above loops runs until end of the array and each time it takes x as array elements index
