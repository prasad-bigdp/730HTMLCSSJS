JS is dynamically typed language, that means there is no fixed data type for the variable. data type of the variable changes from one data type to another data type
let a = 5;
console.log(typeof a) //number
a = "prasad"
console.log(typeof a) //string
a = true;
console.log(typeof a); //boolean

 ---> JS is case sensitive language
 ---> Browser's JS engine will automatically insert 
 semicolon at every line end

Javascript can even change datatypes implicit called implicit type casting
let a = 5;
a = 5 + '5';
a = "prasad" + 2;  //"prasad"+"2"

Javascript data types are divided as two categories
i. primitive data types
ii. non-primitive data types
