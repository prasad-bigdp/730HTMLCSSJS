Array is used to store certain number of elements. Array is a collection of elements
let arr=["raj",20,true]
Arrays are represented by square brackets. Each value in the array is separated by comma and they are called array elements
Every array element contains an unique number to address the element. That is called Index. Indexes are always starts from 
0 and increase by 1
arr[0]="raj";arr[1]=20;arr[2]=true
In JS , arrays don't have any limit

4.unshift: unshift is used to add the values/value at the beginning of the array
5.shift: shift is used to remove the first value of the array
6. splice: splice is used to remove value/values at any specific index and add value/value at specific index
splice(indexValue,deleteCount,insertElements)
7. reverse: reverse is used to reverse the array
8. indexOf(element): it is used to return the index of first occurence of element in given array
9.lastIndexOf(element): it is used to return the last Occurence of element in given array
