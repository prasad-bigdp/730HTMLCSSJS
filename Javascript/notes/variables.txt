Javascript uses variables to store the values. you can declare a variable in three ways i.e., var,let,const
eg: var a=5;  (or) let a=5;   (or) const a=5;

what is the difference between var,let and const?
var is a function scoped variables that can be redeclared, reassigned and also be used before declaration
function x ()
{
    if (true)
    {
        console.log(a); // we can access values before initialization using var
        var a = 5; // var scope is function
        var a = 10;  //redeclare is valid using var
        a = 25; // reassign is also valid using var
    }
   console.log(a) 
}
x();

unitl 2015, JS uses only var, In 2015, It introduces let and const as new ways to declare variables
   
   let and const are block scoped variables which cannot be accessed before declaration and cannot be redeclared.
   let can reassign the value , const cannot reassign the value

/let
function x() {
	if (true) {
		//console.log(a) // we cannot access values before initialization using let and const
		let a = 5 // let , const  scope is block
		//let a = 10 //redeclare is not  valid using let,const
        a = 25 // reassign is also valid using let
        	console.log(a)

	}
}
x()
