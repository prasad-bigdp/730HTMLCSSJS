Event is used to trigger an action. Events are performed by user. There are different kinds of Events such as
  i. mouse Events
  ii. keyboard Events
  iii. form Events
  iv. window events etc..,

  i. mouse events: mouse events are performed by user using the mouse 
  eg: click,dblclick.mouseover,mouseout etc..,

  ii. keyboard events: keyboard events are performed by user using the keyboard.
  eg: keypress

    every time we trigger an action using the event, the function/action receives event object with its values
    for keyboard events, name 'key' contains the value clicked in keyboard

document.addEventListener('keypress', fun)
function fun (e)
{
    if (e.key == 'r')
    {
            document.body.style.background = "red"
    }
}

iii. form events: These are used to handle the inputs and formData
    a. input: it is used to trigger an action when an input is entered
    b. change : it is used to trigger an action when an input value is changed
    c. select : it is used to trigger an action when some value is selected
    d. submit : it is used to trigger an action when some form is submitted
