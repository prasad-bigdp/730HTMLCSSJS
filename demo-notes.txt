Day 2:
Internet Fundamentals:
   i. what is internet?
          internet is a network of networks. A network is a connection. internet connection works as a web which conncets all over the world.

  Initially , US developed ARPANET in 1960's.
  In late 1980's,  Tim Berners Lee initiated WWW at CERN.
  In 1990's browsers came into existence and many website started its global reach
  In 1992, HTML is officially launched. In 1994, CSS is launched. In 1995, Javascript is launched.
  To monitor web technologies, Top companies formed a group for an organization called W3C(world wide web consoritum)

2. How internet Works?
   when we actually type "google.com" in our browsers(client) , it sends request to ISP(Internet service provider) and then it reaches to DNS(domain name system) . In DNS, we can get IP address for given domain and based on IP address, it reaches the server. Then server provides HTML,CSS,JS of "google.com" to client

In simple words, we can frame as "client-server" model
client requests the server
server responds to the client.

Internet Terminologies:
    domain: Domain is the name of the website
    URL : it stands for uniform resource locator . it is nothing but domain with protocol
     eg: https://www.google.com
   Protocol: protocol defines the rules of network/connection
    Eg: http, https, tcp,ip,ftp
    http: hypertext transfer protocol
    https: hypertext transfer protocol secure
    SSL: secure socket layer is a certificate to provide website https
    Hosting: keeping website in a server(deploying)

Day 3:
3. what is the difference between Google, google.com and google chrome?
Google -- search engine:
How? -- seach engines release crawlers for specific keywords and these crawlers checks all websites for those words and returns data. seach engines filters data and ranks them based on multiple factors and displays it
Getting Rank one for website , we follow certain procedures called Search Engine Optimisation(SEO)
Eg: Google, yahoo, duckduckgo,Qmamu,ask.com,bing,yandex
Google.com -- website -- website is a collection of web pages
Google chrome -- browser -- Browsers are multi purposed software specifically used for browsing the internet.
eg: chrome, firefox, edge,safari,opera,brave,vivaldi


4. How exactly web development process works?
      step 1: Requirements gathering, Research, plan website features
      step 2: wireframing and UI,UX Design
                   wireframe: brasic diagrams of how web pages looks
                   UI(user interface) : what you see in web page
                   UX(user experience) : what you feel in web page
      step 3: Developement
                   (frontend - HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, JQuery, React
                    angular,vue, next js, nuxt js, typescript, tailwind)
                   (Backend - PHP(laravel),Python(django) , 
                    Java(spring  boot),Node(express), C#(asp.net))
                   Databases(mongodb,mysql,oracle,cassandra,
                   postgresql, sql server )  
     step4: Testing(unit testing, integration testsing -- 
                 JEST,selenium)
     step 5: deployement/production(aws,netlify,vercel,Azure,
                  Gcloud,hostinger etc..,)
     step 6: Maintainence(Devops - aws-,ci/cd pipelines,docker,
                 kubernetes etc..,)
